## Autopilot ##
# Added in Consul 0.8, this object allows a number of sub-keys to be set which can configure operator-friendly settings for Consul servers.
# When these keys are provided as configuration, they will only be respected on bootstrapping.
# If they are not provided, the defaults will be used. In order to change the value of these options after bootstrapping, you will need to use the Consul Operator Autopilot command.
# For more information about Autopilot, review the Autopilot tutorial.

# This controls the automatic removal of dead server nodes periodically and whenever a new server is added to the cluster. Defaults to true.
consul_autopilot_cleanup_dead_servers: true

# Controls the maximum amount of time a server can go without contact from the leader before being considered unhealthy.
# Must be a duration value such as 10s. Defaults to 200ms
consul_autopilot_last_contact_threshold: "200mc"

# Controls the maximum number of log entries that a server can trail the leader by before being considered unhealthy.
# Defaults to 250
consul_autopilot_max_trailing_logs: 250

# Sets the minimum number of servers necessary in a cluster before autopilot can prune dead servers.
# There is no default.
consul_autopilot_min_quorum: ""

# Controls the minimum amount of time a server must be stable in the 'healthy' state before being added to the cluster.
# Only takes effect if all servers are running Raft protocol version 3 or higher.
# Must be a duration value such as 30s. Defaults to 10s.
