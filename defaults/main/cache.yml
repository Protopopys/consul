## Cache ##
# The size of the token bucket used to recharge the rate-limit per cache entry.
# The default value is 2 and means that when cache has not been updated for a long time, 2 successive queries can be made as long as the rate-limit is not reached.
consul_cache_entry_fetch_max_burst: "2"

# Configures the rate-limit at which the cache may refresh a single entry.
# On a cluster with many changes/s, watching changes in the cache might put high pressure on the servers.
# This ensures the number of requests for a single cache entry will never go beyond this limit, even when a given service changes every 1/100s.
# Since this is a per cache entry limit, having a highly unstable service will only rate limit the watched on this service, but not the other services/entries.
# The value is strictly positive, expressed in queries per second as a float, 1 means 1 query per second, 0.1 mean 1 request every 10s maximum.
# The default value is "No limit" and should be tuned on large clusters to avoid performing too many RPCs on entries changing a lot.
