## Addresses ##
# The address that should be bound to for internal cluster communications.
# This is an IP address that should be reachable by all other nodes in the cluster.
# By default, this is "0.0.0.0", meaning Consul will bind to all addresses on the local machine and will advertise the private IPv4 address to the rest of the cluster.
# If there are multiple private IPv4 addresses available, Consul will exit with an error at startup.
# If you specify "[::]", Consul will advertise the public IPv6 address.
# If there are multiple public IPv6 addresses available, Consul will exit with an error at startup.
# Consul uses both TCP and UDP and the same port for both.
# If you have any firewalls, be sure to allow both protocols.
consul_bind_addr:  "0.0.0.0"

# The address to which Consul will bind client interfaces, including the HTTP and DNS servers.
# By default, this is "127.0.0.1", allowing only loopback connections.
# In Consul 1.0 and later this can be set to a space-separated list of addresses to bind to, or a go-sockaddr template that can potentially resolve to multiple addresses.
consul_client_addr: "127.0.0.1"
